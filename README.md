# Pepper Esports Test

by Lestley Gabo

```
The task I would like you to complete is to pick a public API you like, scrape some data from it and present it in an interesting way using React.
Please provide me with a github repo that has a README file that explains how to run the project locally.
```

# Timezone Color

Goal: pick a city and it should match the time with a color. Time is ratiod (24:255 for hours, 60:255 for minutes and seconds) to RGB based color. (done)

# API used to get time
