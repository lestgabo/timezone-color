# Pepper Esports Test

by Lestley Gabo

```
The task I would like you to complete is to pick a public API you like, scrape some data from it and present it in an interesting way using React.
Please provide me with a github repo that has a README file that explains how to run the project locally.
```

# Timezone Color

Goal: pick a city and it should match the time with a color. Time is ratiod (24:255 for hours, 60:255 for minutes and seconds) to RGB based color. (done)

# API used to get time

http://worldtimeapi.org/

-   unfortunately it's super slow. But it's free and doesn't need a token.

# To run the app in development mode.  
open terminal/command line:  
`mkdir lestley-test`  
`cd lestley-test`  
`git clone https://github.com/lestgabo/timezone-color.git`  
`cd timezone-color`  
`yarn start`  
Then open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
